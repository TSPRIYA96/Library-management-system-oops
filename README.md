# Library-management-system-oops
created a library management system using oops concept..
The following code demonstrates the  OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Project: Library Management System
Features:

•	Issue books to users.
•	Display available books.
•	Implement OOP principles.

OOP Concepts Used
	Encapsulation: Private variables with getter/setter methods.
	Inheritance: EBook extends Book.
	Polymorphism: displayInfo() behaves differently for Book and EBook.
	Abstraction: The user interacts with Library, not ArrayList<Book> directly.

2.	Compile and run using: 
javac -d . *.java
java library.LibraryManagementSystem.
